      "• Author – creates and fixes the work product under review \n",

      "the criticality and complexity of the work product being reviewed, legal or regulatory requirements, and \n",

      "• Informal review. Informal reviews do not follow a defined process and do not require a formal \n",
      "documented output. The main objective is detecting anomalies. \n",
      "• Walkthrough. A walkthrough, which is led by the author, can serve many objectives, such as \n",
